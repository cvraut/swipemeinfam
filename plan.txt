This file will contain all the stuff we need to do in order to make this project happen
(Like a todo list):

build a database that one can read and write to from different machines

need to set up a time to physically swipe

SQL lite 
flask API

create a hashed id to identify them

recent activity
location -> dining hall(pippins, brandy or anteatery)

display list of results to find specific person

get request -> the whole table om #'d id

post request -> adding info by indexs  

5 image avatars

server stores the 5 images

when updated, updated from
credibility index

Server holds Database and list of predefined images:

DataBase consists of:
name:
  first_name(str)
  last_name(str)
ucinetid:
  ucinetid(str)
  * this will also be the key for the entire row of the DB
# of swipes:
  num_swipes(int)
times:
  WD(str: '(int: day of week):(int: hr start)-(int: hr stop);*')
  WE(str: '(int: day of week):(int: hr start)-(int: hr stop);*')
cost of swipe:
  cost_swipe(num)
IMG ID:
  img_name(str)
location:
  pippins(bool)
  anteatery(bool)
last updated:
  updated(str: "(int: year):(int: month):(int: day):(int: hour):(int: min):(int: secs)")
credability index:
  cred(num: default 0.0)
updated from:
  updated_from(str: ip address from where this row was mutated)
GPS:
  lat(num: default 0.0)
  lng(num: default 0.0)

API
POST:
    add info based on ucinetid
    update one field in a row based on var name and ucinetid
GET:
    returns the entire database as a JSON
    returns a single row based on ucinetid
    
APP:
    search db for specified fields based on passed predicate functions -> returns list of rows that satisfy
    
we have to use a NoSQL database giving us key-value pairs
Flask for API

do main work in python
