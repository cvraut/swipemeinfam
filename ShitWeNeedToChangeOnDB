Add # of successes (int, default = 0)
Add # of fails/bad reviews (int, default = 1)
Add total response time to email request in days (int, default 1)

Change times to a single str (str, ex. '0:18:00-19:00' or '4:12:00-13:00') --> The first number represents the day of the week.
So the first time represents Sunday at 6:00-7:00pm, and the second time represents Thursday at 12:00 - 1:00pm. (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, etc.)
